Born in Russia, moved to Minsk 3 years ago. Now I study at BSU School of Business. I realized in my second year that Logistics is not mine and I got fired up with the idea to change my life.<br> For half a year I have been learning programming on my own. There is no commercial experience in creating websites and writing programs.<br>Now I writing an HTML, CSS (SASS) and delved into JS. I typeset partially according to the BEM methodology. I use VS code as a framework. I prefer Git from version control systems. I also use the GULP preprocessor if necessary.

Didn't take any courses. This is my first time. He studied himself using videos by Dmitry Valak (YouTube: BrainsCloud) and Vladilen Minin (YouTube: Vladilen Minin)

My knowledge of English is lame, I often use Google translator. I wrote this CV with the help of a translator.
